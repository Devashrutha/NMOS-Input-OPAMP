<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction

The most popular approach for CMOS OPAMPs has been the two-stage architecture. It consists of a differential input stage followed by a second gain stage. In some cases where the output is a resistive load, a buffer is used. OPAMPs usually have low output impedance as they are used as amplifiers so that maximum power is transferred to the load. This design includes an NMOS input differential amplifier with an NMOS current mirror and PMOS active load followed by a common source amplifier. There are several advantages to choosing NMOS input MOSFETs instead of PMOS. 

Here's why:
* NMOS input OPAMPS typically have low input impedance, which means they are less prone to input capacitance problems.
* They offer high-speed operation for use in DSP circuits.
* They consume less power than their counterpart making them more power-efficient.
* Better noise performance.

Of course, the choice between NMOS input and PMOS input depends on the application and requirements.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Using Cadence Virtuoso with gpdk90 technology we shall first use the above specifications to find the (W/L) ratios for the various MOSFETs. All the manual calculations are included in the project directory.

### Prerequisites

Before finding the (W/L) ratios we need to know the upCox and unCox values of PMOS and NMOS by driving them to saturation or region 2. Let us consider ```L = 1um, W = 10um, Ibias = 50uA, VDD = 3V```. Using the following schematic we find the DC operating points using the DC analysis in the ADE window.

<div align ="center">
  <img src = "/Pictures/Schematic/unCox.png">
</div>

The Beff(Effective beta) is found from each of the MOSFETs using the above W and L. Then we find the upCox and unCox using the formula: 

```math
\begin{aligned}
& Beta_p = \mu_p \ {Cox} \left(\frac{W}{L}\right)\ and\ Beta_n = \mu_n \ {Cox} \left(\frac{W}{L}\right)\\
& \mu_p \text { Cox }=160 \mu \mathrm{A} / V^2\ and \mu_n \text { Cox }=315 \mu \mathrm{A} / V^2\\
\end{aligned}
```

Now let us consider the minimum ```L = 240nm``` (L>2*90nm) to avoid any effect of Channel Length Modulation, ```Cc = 600fF``` and the ```Slew Rate = 20uA``` (Ibias/Cc, ends up to be 12uA but its the minimum). Using the following schematic can find the W/L ratios. The schematic also contains 1 NMOS device and 1 PMOS device that act as a `Dummy`, each with a multiplier 2 to protect the critical `Differential Input NMOSs` and the `PMOS active loads` against any `process variations` due to the `guard ring around` them.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Design of M1 and M2

The design of M1 and M2 depends on the ```GBP``` and ```Cc```

```math
\begin{aligned}
& g_{m_1} =GBP \times C_c \times 2 \pi \\
& g_{m_1} =113.1 \mu \mathrm{S}\\
& \therefore Let\ g_{m_1} =120 \mu \mathrm{s}\\
& I_D =\mu_n \text{Cox}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right) \cdot \frac{\left(V_{G S}-V_t\right)^2}{2} \\
& g_m =\frac{\partial I_{D S}}{\partial V_{G S}}=\mu_n \text{Cox}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)\left(V_{G S}-V_T\right)\\
& {g_{m}}^2=\left[\mu_n \text{Cox}\left(\frac{w}{L}\right)\right]^2 \frac{\left(V_{G S}-V_{t}\right)^2}{2} \times 2 \\
& {g_m}^2=2 I_D \times \mu_n \text{Cox}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)\\
& \left(\frac{W}{L}\right) = 2.28575\\
& \therefore Let\left(\frac{W}{L}\right) = 3\\
\end{aligned}
```

<!-- Design of M3 and M4 -->
## Design of M3 and M4

The design of M3 and M4 depends on ```ICMR+```, consider only M3 and M1 from the OPAMP schematic.
```math
\begin{align}
& I_3 = \mu_p \text{C}_{ox}\left(\frac{W}{L}\right) \frac{\left(V_{GS}-V_{t}\right)^2}{2} \\
& V_{GS} = \sqrt{\frac{2 I_3}{\mu_p \text{C}_{ox}}} + \left|V_{t3}\right| \\
& \therefore\, V_{D1} = V_{DD} - \sqrt{\frac{2 I_3}{\beta_p}} - \left|V_{t3}\right| \\
& ICMR^{+} \leq V_{D1} + V_{t1} \\
& \left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_3 = \frac{2 I_{D3}}{\left.\mu_p \text{C}_{ox}\left[V_{DD} - ICMR^{+} - \left|V_{t3}\right|_{\text{max}} + V_{t1}\right]_{\text{min}}\right]^2}
\end{align}
```
Now we need to find Vt3max and Vt1min. This can be done using another schematic consisting of only the differential input stage of the OPAMP and simulating the DC operating points in the ADE.

<div align ="center">
  <img src = "/Pictures/Schematic/VtminVtmax.png">
</div>

We then get:

```Vt3max``` = -227.588mV, Let it be ```-240mV```

```Vt1min``` = 178.866mV, Let it be ```160mV```

```math
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{W}{L}_{3,4}=8.681 \\
& \therefore \text { Let } \frac{W}{L}_{3,4}=9
\end{aligned}
```
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- Design of M5 and M8 -->
## Design of M5 and M8

The design of M5 and M8 depends on ```ICMR-```, consider only M2 and M5 from the OPAMP schematic.

```math
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{\left(I C M R^{-}\right)}{V_{\min }} \geqslant{V_{GS1_{max}}+V_{\text {DSat5 }}} \\
& I C M R^{-} \geqslant\left[\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{D_1}}{\beta_1}}+V t_1\right]_{\max }+V_{\text {Dsat }} \\

& V_{\text {Dsat }} \leq I C M R^{-}-\sqrt{\frac{2 I_{D 1}}{\beta_1}}-V_{t_1 \max } \\

& V_{\text {Dsat }}=468.521 \mathrm{mV} \\
& \text {But VDsat minimum is } 184 \mathrm{mV} \text {. Let us take } 200 \mathrm{mV} \\
& \therefore \text { VDsat }=200 \mathrm{mV} \\
& \left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{5,8}=\frac{2 I_{D 5}}{\mu_n C_{ox}\left(V_{\text {Dsat }}\right)^2} \\
& \therefore\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_{5,8}=3 \\
&
\end{aligned}
```

<!-- Design of M6 -->
## Design of M6

The design of M6 depends on ```PM```, to achieve 60 degrees PM:
```math
\begin{gathered}
& g_{m6} \geqslant 10 \cdot g_{m 1} \\
& g_{m6} \geqslant 1200 \mu . \\
& \frac{\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_6}{\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_4}=\frac{I_6}{I_4}=\frac{g_{m 6}}{g_{m 4}} \\
& q \\
& g_{m4}=\sqrt{\mu_p C_{ox}\cdot\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_4 \cdot 2 I_D} \\

& g_{m_4}=169.11 \mu \\

& \therefore\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_6=64
\end{gathered}
```


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- Design of M7 -->
## Design of M7

The design of M6 depends on ```W/L of M6```:
```math
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{I_6}{I_4}=\frac{(W / L)_6}{(W / L)_4} \\
& I_6=\simeq 72 \mu \mathrm{A} \\
& \frac{\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_7}{\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_5}=\frac{I_6}{I_5} \\
& \therefore\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)_7=12
\end{aligned}
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- Adjusted (W/L) Ratios -->
## Adjusted Width and Length Ratios

After the schematic simulation, some adjustment needs to be made to the (W/L) ratios of some of the MOSFETs to meet the specifications.

The length of M7 is changed from 240n to 800n therefore making the width 9.6u maintaining the same (W/L) ratio calculated previously. To maintain monotonicity and matching the L of M5 and M8 are also changed to 800n. This has no effect on the ```PM```, ```Slew Rate``` and brings some improvement in the overall gain. 

The final widths and lengths for the MOSFETs are:


| MOSFET       | WIDTH (W)      | LENGTH (L)    | (W/L) RATIO  |
|    :---:     |     :---:      |     :---:     |   :---:      |
| `M1 & M2`    | 720n           | 240n          | `3`          |
| `M3 & M4`    | 2.16u          | 240n          | `9`          |
| `M5 & M8`    | 2.4u           | 800n          | `3`          |
| `M6`         | 15.35u         | 240n          | `64`         |
| `M7`         | 9.6u           | 800n          | `12`         |

Further improvements can be made to increase the gain, GBP, and PM of the OPAMP by simulating and re-adjusting the ratios.

<!-- Layout Design -->
## Layout Design

The layout design below shows the NMOS input OPAMP with the PMOS coupling capacitor. 

<div align="center">
  <img src= "/Pictures/Layout/nmos_opamp_lay.png">
</div>


* The floorplan is based on `Constructive Placement` following the `min-cut` algorithm. Where the devices are placed such that there are minimum connection edges across the boundaries.
* All the metal layers are modified to have equal width and T structures are avoided wherever possible. This reduces the chances of electromigration effects (Hillocks or Voids).
* M1 in `Blue`, M2 in `Red`, M3 in `Light Green`, Poly in `Dark Green`
* The critical device being the differential pair is placed such that it results in minimum trace length between other devices and itself.
* The PMOS devices are placed in their `nwells` since the PMOSCAP does not share the same body voltage as the other PMOSs it resides in its nwell.
* A `PMOSCAP` was used instead of a `mimcap` to save space. We know that the gate capacitance of a MOSFET can mimic a capacitor when all the other terminals (D, S, B) are shorted.
* The `guard rings` are basically `large taps` that help to isolate devices from each other creating a low resistance well. It `prevents any charge buildup` and `noise` by other devices from affecting the operation of the guarded group.
* The pins `Ibias`, `V+`, `V-`, and `Vout` are brought up to M3 while the VSS and VDD pins are left at M1. This really depends on the overall design in which this OPAMP might sit.
* The total area occupied by this 11 MOSFET OPAMP is `170pm^2`.
